# Getting Mastodon working with Amazon S3 file-hosting

This document explains what these options in the mastodon config file are for
and how you configure them:

S3_ENABLED
S3_BUCKET
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
S3_REGION
S3_PROTOCOL
S3_HOSTNAME

# What / Why

The most disk-space-intensive part of hosting a mastodon instance is hosting all
of your users' content, that is their avatars, header images, and attachments.
Not only that, but all remote users which are brought into your instance via
people following them or viewing their profile also create local copies of these
kinds of content.

Having all this content sit on the same server as the rest of the mastodon
instance can make it difficult to do backups (there will be more contention for
disk while the backup is occurring) and create problems down the line if you
start running out of space. Also, serving the file data over the same pipe as
the web data could bottleneck your network connection.

To solve this, Mastodon supports offloading these kinds of assets onto an Amazon
S3 bucket. If you're not familiar, Amazon S3 is kind of like a hard drive in the
cloud, which is optimized for serving static (infrequently changing) content
very quickly. A large percent of websites today use it to serve images,
stylesheets, big data files, and so on. (Note that this also means if it ever
goes down, like one S3 region did a few months ago, your instance will be
affected along with a large chunk of the rest of the web. That's a fairly
unlikely occurrence that doesn't weight very heavily against the other concerns,
though).

## Cost

Amazon charges both for how much data you're storing on the cloud ($0.020 -
$0.030 per GB) and how much is transferred out due to e.g. serving web requests
($0.020 - $0.250 per GB past the first GB). Prices are given in ranges because
they differ depending on what region (datacenter) you tell it to use -- US,
Canada and EU datacenters tend to run cheapest.

For a small instance, this will most likely amount to less than $1 / month.

# How

## Setting up AWS and an S3 Bucket

(Feel free to skim this if you know how to make an S3 bucket already, but check
the !!IMPORTANT!! note below.)

First, you'll need to create an AWS account. Go to
[aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/) and sign up if you haven't already.
You'll need a credit card so that Amazon can charge you for the costs
noted above. **Note:** amazon may ask you which region you'd like to be in at this
point, but this will not affect which region your S3 bucket is in -- it will
ask about that later.

Now go to [console.aws.amazon.com](https://console.aws.amazon.com/), click on
Services, and navigate to **S3** (under **Storage**). You'll be looking at a
list, probably empty, which will show your bucket when it's created. Click
**Create bucket**. Here's where you'll fill in the bucket information, including
the bucket name (which we'll call $S3_BUCKET) and the region (which we'll 
call $S3_REGION) for the bucket to be in. 

**!!IMPORTANT!!**: The bucket name must NOT contain any dots (.), or you will
not be able to serve content over HTTPS! The Amazon HTTPS certificates are only
wildcarded for one level of domain name, so they will cover domains like:

    https://mastodon.s3.amazonaws.com

but NOT domain names like:

    https://masto.mycoolsite.s3.amazonaws.com

The other bucket settings don't need to be changed, so you can now click
"Create" to create the bucket.

## Setting up an AWS API Key

You'll also need to create an API keypair that Mastodon can use to upload
content to the S3 bucket. Go to [console.aws.amazon.com](https://console.aws.amazon.com/),
click on Services, and navigate to **IAM** (under **Security, Identity, &
Compliance**). On the side column, click on **Users**, then **Add user**. Put in
a descriptive name (like "Mastodon-API"), and enable "Programmatic access". You
can add this user to the "Administrators" group if you like, or if you're
paranoid you can create a new group for it (make sure it has
AmazonS3FullAccess). Finish creating the user, and copy its **Access key ID**
and **Secret access key** (which we'll call $AWS_ACCESS_KEY and $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) 
down somewhere -- you'll need them later.

## Configuring Mastodon to use the S3 bucket

### Transitioning from an existing server

**!!IMPORTANT!!** If your Mastodon server has already been live for a while, you
*need* to upload all of the content to the s3 bucket before continuing! (If
you're setting up a new server, you can skip this section).

Also, these instructions are specific to manual deployments, you may need to
modify paths slightly for docker or other automatic deployments.

Install the command line tool `s3cmd`:

    sudo apt-get install s3cmd

(As the Mastodon user, if you aren't already) Run the configuration wizard to set up API access:

    s3cmd --configure

Navigate to your mastodon deployment folder, e.g.:

    cd ~mastodon/live

Now run the following command. Substitute the name of your bucket for $S3_BUCKET:

    s3cmd --acl-public sync public/system/ s3://$S3_BUCKET

This may take a while depending on how long your instance has been running.

**!!IMPORTANT!!**: You may **also** need to perform another copy after updating the Mastodon config, 
depending on how active your server is -- attachments, avatars, and headers can
be created between when this tool runs and when you switch out the config!

### Filling out the config

Open up the mastodon environment config in your favorite text editor:

    nano .env.production

Here's where we'll update those lines you saw earlier. Uncomment all the s3
lines and fill them out with the values we've been keeping track of. That is,
don't just copy and paste this, make sure to fill in the actual values I told
you to keep track of in all the places where there are $VARIABLES:

    S3_ENABLED=true
    S3_BUCKET=$S3_BUCKET
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS
    S3_REGION=$S3_REGION
    S3_PROTOCOL=https
    S3_HOSTNAME=s3-$S3_REGION.amazonaws.com                        

Your S3 region name needs to be a lowercase, dash-delimited version of whatever
region you created the bucket in -- Amazon provides these [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html).
For example, for region "US West (Oregon)", you would fill them in as follows:

    S3_REGION=us-west-2
    S3_HOSTNAME=s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com                        

Mastodon will use the protocol and hostname parameters when generating the URLs
for the content it displays on the page. I haven't yet determined why it needs
to know the region but I assume it has something to do with the API calls it
makes.

## Restarting Mastodon

Now restart your mastodon server (or start it up if it's a fresh one). e.g.:

    sudo systemctl restart mastodon-*.service

**Now is the time** to perform another upload of all the local files if your
server was running between the time you did the last upload and now. You will be
missing content, otherwise.

Go to your web browser to double check that it's working. If you can see
people's avatars and attachments, and your attachment URLs look like the
following, then you're good to go!

    https://cybre.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/media_attachments/files/000/005/330/original/halebopp_dimai_960.jpg?1491719606

## Troubleshooting

Here are some problems you might encounter while getting this up and running. If
you encounter new ones and figure out how to solve them, let me know and I'll
update this document.

### Avatars / attachments are blank

Either the URLs mastodon is generating for the bucket path are incorrect, or
something about the way they are being served is incorrect. Right click on a
broken attachment and open it in a new tab. You might see one of a few things:

**SSL certificate error**: Either you didn't listen to me above about not having
. in your domain name, or something is wrong with the way the URL is generating.
Double check your bucket name in the config file.

**S3 XML showing not found message**: Files from pre-S3 may not have been copied into the
bucket correctly. Double check that the basic paths of the copy were okay by
going to the bucket root in the AWS console: you should see at least "accounts"
"media_attachments" and maybe "preview_cards" folders.

If just a few images are blank, you may also have missed a few files in between
copying the files onto the bucket and restarting your mastodon server. (You can
check if this is the case by taking the path after the domain name -- e.g.
accounts/avatars/... -- and checking if the file exists in your mastodon
deployment under public/system/accounts/avatars/...)

**S3 XML showing AccessDenied message**: The permissions on either the files or
the bucket are not set correctly. The files should have a permission for
"Everyone" that allows them to Read the file. Mastodon does this by default for
all files it creates; you may have omitted "--acl-public" or an equivalent
parameter when copying the files into the bucket.

### Mastodon won't start / displays an error page

It may not be able to access the AWS API or its API calls are failing. Double
check the bucket name, region name, and your access and secret keys.
